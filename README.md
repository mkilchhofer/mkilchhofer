Gr√ºezi from Switzerland :switzerland:! My name is Marco and I work as a System Engineer at Swiss Post :european_post_office:. I live near the capital city.

I started my career with an apprenticeship as an electronics technician in 2005. After tinkering with electonic stuff like drawing schematics and layout PCBs, 
repairing power supplies and xDSL modems and writing assembler and C for microcontrollers in the first three years, I luckily came to the embedded Linux world
in my last year of the apprenticeship: Linux based LAN switches, routers and PBXes for mission critical communication.

I then switched into the public sector to the market leader in public bus transport here in Switzerland for modernizing the IT systems inside the ~2000 busses :bus:.
We proved that microservices and containers aren't just limited to datacenters and the cloud but are also working great in the edge. Okay we had to use a lots
of memory in such a vehicle but hey: memory is dirt cheap today :rofl:. Unfortunately there was no K8s for the edge like k3s at this time, so we used
docker-compose.

In summer 2019 I started a new job in a team of the department "application operations" called SRE. I know, what we did here daily corresponds only
rudimentarily with what Google defined in their books. But, our team was the first team in this company which brought Dev and Ops closer together. :raised_hands:

Since January 2021 I switched back to the umbrella organization from the IoT project with the busses. Not because they always search new people for this project
again, but because they decided to have a cloud-first strategy :cloud:. I now support [@swisspost](https://github.com/swisspost/) as a Platform engineer around Kubernetes topics :wheel_of_dharma:.
